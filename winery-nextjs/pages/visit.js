            Vineyard, Cave and Winery tours are available by appointment. The
            vineyard tour depends on the weather. The cave winery is protected
            from the weather making it always available for tasting and tour.

            The fall is the best time if you want to taste fruit in the
            vineyard, see harvest activities and the winemaking and fermentation
            process. The rest of the year is at a slower pace. We try to offer a
            barrel tasting of wines at various stages of the wine making process
            when available.
          </p>

            We offer for tasting of our released Cabernet Sauvignon and
            Chardonnay wines. The tasting fee for the tour and one vintage is
            $25.00 per person.

            Our Cave is also available for special events. Contact us for more
            information.
